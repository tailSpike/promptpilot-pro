# 🚀 PromptPilot Pro

PromptPilot Pro is an AI workflow operations platform that helps teams design, execute, and monitor structured prompts plus automation triggers in a single workspace. The monorepo ships a production-ready TypeScript API, a modern React dashboard, and a scheduling layer that keeps workflows on time.

## 🌟 Feature highlights

### Core workspace
- Secure JWT authentication, scoped resources, and folder-based organization
- Prompt authoring with variable templates, metadata, and semantic version history
- Branch-aware prompt management with diff-friendly audit trails

### Collaboration & sharing (Epic 3 Story 1)
- Owner-to-viewer library sharing under feature flag `collaboration.sharing`
- Share modal with member search, invite rate limiting, and revoke controls
- "Shared with me" workspace view for read-only access to approved prompts
- Audit, analytics, and email hooks wired for compliance-ready telemetry

### Workflow automation
- Drag-and-drop workflow builder with PROMPT, CONDITION, TRANSFORM, DELAY, WEBHOOK, and DECISION steps
- Rich configuration forms, inline validation, and live preview of downstream variables
- Execution history with recent run summaries and step-level logging

### Testing & preview (Epic 2 Story 3)
- One-click workflow previews with manual JSON input or auto-generated sample data
- Step-by-step result explorer with duration, token estimates, warnings, and error stacks
- Final output sandbox that highlights the executed payload without persisting history
- Cypress end-to-end coverage for preview flows, including validation, sample-data toggles, and manual payloads

### Trigger automation (Epic 2 Story 2)
- Five trigger types: **Manual**, **Scheduled**, **Webhook**, **API**, and **Event** (extensible scaffold)
- `TriggerService` drives node-cron scheduling with graceful startup/shutdown and timezone support
- Secure secrets: automatic webhook HMAC secrets & API keys scoped per trigger
- Frontend trigger console with simple/advanced scheduling modes, cron helpers, and inline examples
- Execution metadata captured on the backend for upcoming workflow-run integration

### Developer experience
- Type-safe React + Vite frontend and Express + Prisma backend
- PowerShell & Bash scripts for start/stop/status, Prisma sync, database resets, and hook installation
- GitHub Actions CI covering linting, builds, unit/integration tests, and Cypress smoke flows

## 🧭 Architecture snapshot
- **Monorepo layout**: `backend/` (Express API, Prisma, scheduling), `frontend/` (React SPA), `docs/` (living architecture reference), `scripts/`.
- **API layer**: Express routes backed by service classes (`WorkflowService`, `TriggerService`, etc.) with Zod validation and Prisma data access.
- **Scheduler**: `TriggerService` hydrates active cron jobs on boot, persists configs in `workflow_triggers`, and tears them down during shutdown.
- **Database**: SQLite for development/test with Prisma migrations; PostgreSQL-ready for production via `DATABASE_URL` swap.
- **Frontend**: Vite + Tailwind UI consuming the REST API with shared TypeScript models and trigger-focused UX.

## ⚡ Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (20 recommended) & npm 9+
- PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows) or Bash/Zsh (macOS/Linux)
- Git
- SQLite (bundled) or PostgreSQL for production deployments

### One-command bootstrap (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
# Clone and launch everything with managed processes
git clone https://github.com/tailSpike/promptpilot-pro.git
cd promptpilot-pro
./start.ps1

# Check service status
./status.ps1

# Stop services when finished
./stop.ps1
```

### Manual setup (cross-platform)
```bash
# Install workspace dependencies
npm run install:all

# Prepare and start the backend (terminal 1)
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev

# Start the frontend (terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`, backend on `http://localhost:3001` by default.

### Environment variables
Create `.env` files in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

**backend/.env**
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"     # Swap to postgres:// for production
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:5173"
FEATURE_FLAG_COLLABORATION_SHARING="on"   # Toggle library sharing skeleton

# Multi-model provider credentials (leave blank to use simulated responses)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="azr-..."
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-04-01-preview"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."

# Control which providers are accepted in workflow steps
ALLOWED_MODEL_PROVIDERS="openai,azure,anthropic,google,custom"
```

If the provider keys are omitted the backend falls back to safe, simulated responses so builders can test the UI without contacting external APIs.

**frontend/.env**
```
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```

## 🧰 Useful npm scripts
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start backend & frontend concurrently |
| `npm run build` | Production build for both workspaces |
| `npm run start` | Serve compiled assets (`backend/dist`, Vite preview) |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` | ESLint across backend and frontend (optional fix) |
| `npm run test:backend` | Jest unit + integration suites (SQLite in-memory) |
| `npm run test:frontend` | Vitest component/unit suite |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Build, reset DB, launch services, and run Cypress headless (includes library sharing journey) |
| `npm run prepare:e2e` | Reset test database without executing Cypress |
| `npm run ci` | Local mirror of the GitHub Actions pipeline |

Backend-only scripts live under `backend/package.json` (`db:generate`, `db:reset`, `start:test`, etc.), while frontend scripts cover Cypress (`npm run e2e`, `npm run e2e:open`).

---

## ✅ Testing & quality gates
- **Backend**: Jest unit and integration tests execute against a real SQLite database (`npm run test:backend`).
- **Frontend**: Vitest exercises React components and utilities (`npm run test:frontend`).
- **End-to-end**: Cypress specs validate major flows, including trigger management and workflow preview/testing journeys (`npm run test:e2e`). Global retries (`runMode=2`) cushion known flake while specs are expanded.
- **Static analysis**: ESLint + TypeScript rules enforced via `npm run lint` and pre-push hooks.

## 🛣️ Status & next steps
- Scheduled triggers currently log their intent; wiring into the workflow execution engine is tracked in `TriggerService` TODOs.
- Manual trigger execution (`POST /api/triggers/:id/execute`) and webhook callbacks return acknowledgements while runtime integration is finalized.
- Workflow previews currently simulate execution in-process and return the result envelope without persisting history; follow-up work will allow saving previews and reusing sample payloads.
- Cypress coverage for trigger CRUD/execution flows is in progress; see the test TODOs in `docs/DEV_GUIDE.md` before treating failures as regressions.
- `EVENT` trigger type exists for forward compatibility and will be wired to internal bus integrations in a subsequent epic.
