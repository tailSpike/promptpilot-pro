# Memory Notes for PromptPilot Pro Development

## PowerShell Service Management Scripts âš¡

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the PowerShell automation scripts we created for service management:

- **Start services**: `.\start.ps1` - Starts both backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 5173)
- **Check status**: `.\status.ps1` - Shows service status, PIDs, and health checks
- **Stop services**: `.\stop.ps1` - Cleanly stops all Node.js processes

**DO NOT** manually start services with npm commands - use the automation scripts instead!

## Key Configuration Details

- **Backend API**: Runs on port 3001 (not 5000)
- **Frontend Dev**: Runs on port 5173 
- **Cypress config**: 
  - `baseUrl`: http://localhost:5173 (frontend)
  - `apiUrl`: http://localhost:3001 (backend API)
- **Service management**: Fully automated with PowerShell scripts

## E2E Test Success

We achieved **100% test success rate (79/79 passing)** by:
1. Using proper service management scripts
2. Fixing backend port configuration in Cypress
3. Resolving authentication flow issues
4. Implementing proper error handling
5. Removing redundant/flaky tests to achieve 100% clarity

## Workflow Fixes Applied

- Added comprehensive workflows API module to frontend with step management
- Fixed JSON parsing errors in WorkflowList and WorkflowEditor
- Updated all workflow components to use new API structure
- Enhanced error handling for empty responses
- **STEP CREATION FIXED**: Added complete step management API endpoints
- **COMPREHENSIVE E2E TESTS**: 100% passing (14/14) with full Epic 2 Story 1 coverage
- **Workflow execution, deletion, and editing**: All fully functional
- **JSON parsing in Cypress**: Fixed with parseSpecialCharSequences: false

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Complete Test Suite Protocol 

**MANDATORY BEFORE ANY COMMIT/PUSH:**

Always run the complete test suite and ensure ALL tests pass before considering any work complete:

### Required Test Execution Order:
1. **Unit Tests**: `npm test` or `npm run test:unit` - Test individual functions/methods
2. **Component Tests**: `npm run test:component` or `npx cypress run --component` - Test React components in isolation  
3. **Integration Tests**: `npm run test:integration` - Test API endpoints and service interactions
4. **End-to-End Tests**: `npx cypress run` - Test complete user workflows

### Pre-Commit Checklist:
- [ ] âœ… All unit tests passing
- [ ] âœ… All component tests passing  
- [ ] âœ… All integration tests passing
- [ ] âœ… All E2E tests passing (current: 100% success rate - 79/79 tests)
- [ ] âœ… No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] âœ… No TypeScript errors (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] âœ… Services running properly with `.\start.ps1`

### Test Commands to Run:
```bash
# Start services first
.\start.ps1

# Run all test suites
cd backend && npm test
cd ../frontend && npm test
cd frontend && npx cypress run --component  
cd frontend && npx cypress run

# Verify no errors
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

### Test Evolution and Adaptation:
**It's OK to write code that breaks existing tests** - but we MUST address test failures by:

1. **Evaluate test effectiveness**: Is the failing test still relevant for the new functionality?
2. **Fix the test**: Update test assertions/expectations to match new behavior
3. **Remove obsolete tests**: Delete tests that no longer apply to current functionality  
4. **Add new tests**: Create tests that validate the new functionality properly

### Final Rule:
**NEVER commit code with failing tests that haven't been properly evaluated and addressed!**

The goal is test suite evolution, not test suite preservation. Tests should serve the code, not constrain valid improvements.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: CI Pipeline Monitoring

**MANDATORY AFTER EVERY COMMIT/PUSH:**

Always verify that the CI pipeline runs successfully after pushing code:

### Post-Push CI Verification Protocol:
1. **Monitor CI Status**: Immediately check GitHub Actions/CI pipeline status after push
2. **Watch Pipeline Execution**: Ensure all CI jobs complete successfully (build, test, lint, etc.)
3. **Verify Test Results**: Confirm all tests pass in the CI environment, not just locally
4. **Check Build Artifacts**: Ensure production builds complete without errors
5. **Validate Deployment**: If auto-deployment is configured, verify successful deployment

### CI Failure Response:
- [ ] âœ… Identify failing CI jobs/steps immediately
- [ ] âœ… Review CI logs and error messages
- [ ] âœ… Fix issues locally and test thoroughly
- [ ] âœ… Push fixes and re-monitor CI status
- [ ] âœ… Repeat until CI is 100% green

### Never Consider Work Complete Until:
- [ ] âœ… All local tests pass
- [ ] âœ… Code is committed and pushed
- [ ] âœ… **CI pipeline shows ALL GREEN status**
- [ ] âœ… All CI jobs complete successfully
- [ ] âœ… No deployment issues or warnings

**Remember**: Local success â‰  CI success. Environment differences, dependency versions, and configuration can cause CI-specific failures that don't appear locally.
