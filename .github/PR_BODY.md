## Summary
- Delivers Epic 3 Story 1 by shipping the library sharing skeleton behind the `collaboration.sharing` feature flag so owners can invite teammates into prompt libraries.
- Documents the sharing flow, locks down backend permissions, and hardens the Cypress journey to keep invite → accept → view green in CI.

## Key changes
### Backend
- Adds prompt library share persistence (Prisma schema + migrations), service guardrails, and audit logging hooks for create/revoke flows.
- Exposes `POST /api/libraries/:id/shares`, `DELETE /api/libraries/:id/shares/:shareId`, and `GET /api/libraries/shared-with-me` with feature-flag gating, membership checks, and analytics events.
- Extends auth middleware and test utilities so shared-library viewers can read prompts while non-members receive 403s.

### Frontend
- Introduces the share modal, shared-with-me panel, and toast UX so owners can invite and viewers can discover shared libraries.
- Tags folder tree nodes and share controls with deterministic data attributes, smoothing Cypress selectors and asynchronous loading states.
- Threads feature-flagged permission checks through prompt list/tree components to prevent unauthorized edits while the flag is off.

### Testing, Tooling & Docs
- Expands Cypress with a stabilized `library-sharing` spec (explicit intercepts, waits, and fixtures) to exercise invite, accept, and revoke.
- Updates README, DEV_GUIDE, API docs, and workflow manual checklist with flag instructions, endpoints, and QA steps for collaboration sharing.
- Captures manual verification steps and story documentation under `docs/EPIC3_STORY1.md` to guide rollout and follow-up work.

## Testing
- `npm run build:frontend`
- `npm run test:e2e`

## Follow-ups / Notes
- Future collaboration stories will layer editing, notifications, and granular roles on top of this skeleton; rate limiting and audit hooks are in place for that expansion.
