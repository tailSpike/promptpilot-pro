## Summary
- Delivers Epic 2 Story 2 by layering a full trigger and scheduling system on top of the existing workflow automation stack.
- Extends both backend services and frontend UX so workflows can be executed manually, on schedules, via webhooks, or programmatically, while keeping the experience approachable.

## Key changes
### Backend
- Adds `WorkflowTrigger` data model, schema migration, and relations so executions can track their launch source.
- Introduces `TriggerService` with node-cron powered scheduling, secure secret/api-key generation, and graceful startup/shutdown handling of scheduled jobs.
- Exposes authenticated REST endpoints under `/api/workflows/:workflowId/triggers` plus trigger CRUD/execute/webhook routes, wired into existing auth middleware.
- Updates Prisma helpers, workflow services, and tests to normalize trigger config, capture execution metadata, and seed hooks for future workflow execution.
- Refreshes backend tooling (`node-cron`, typed config, new global setup) to support trigger validation and repeatable test resets.

### Frontend
- Ships a new `WorkflowTriggers` experience with simple/advanced scheduling modes, cron helpers, realtime descriptions, toast feedback, and per-trigger action menus.
- Extends workflow screens (`WorkflowDetail`, `WorkflowEditor`, `WorkflowList`) to surface trigger state, quick actions, and execution summaries.
- Adds trigger-focused Cypress suites plus broader workflow E2E coverage, richer fixtures, and support utilities for regression scenarios.
- Polishes global UI—including Tailwind tweaks, API helper additions, and comprehensive README/product docs—to explain trigger types, examples, and best practices.

### Tooling & Docs
- Provides fresh contributor guidance (`DEV_GUIDE`, `TESTING`, scripts for hooks/e2e) so teammates can set up, lint, and test consistently.
- Adds `.npmrc` to preserve workspace binary links during CI and new GitHub workflows (CI, Cypress, epic-specific) to exercise the expanded surface area.
- Seeds `.github/instructions/memory.instruction.md` and related automation content to coordinate review guidelines and runtime behavior.

## Testing
- `npm run build`

## Follow-ups / Notes
- Trigger execution currently acknowledges work and schedules jobs; integrating real workflow execution inside the scheduled/task paths is marked as a TODO in `TriggerService`.
- Webhook handling endpoints return acknowledgements today—the HMAC verification scaffolding is in place and ready for deeper integration.
