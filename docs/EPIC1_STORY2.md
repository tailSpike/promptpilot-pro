# Epic 1 Story 2: Hierarchical Organization System

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize prompts into folders, tags, and categories so I can find and iterate quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality

- ✅ **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag-and-drop prompt organization between folders using native HTML5 controls
- ✅ **Folder Management**: Folder management (create, rename, delete) with inline editing
- ✅ **Real-time Sync**: Real-time folder name synchronization across prompt displays
- ✅ **Smart Migration**: Smart content migration when folders are deleted (prompts moved to "All Prompts")
- ✅ **Search & Filter**: Search and filter capabilities across folder structures
