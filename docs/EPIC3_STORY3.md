# Epic 3 Story 3: Marketplace Publishing Skeleton üöß DISCOVERY

## üìã User Story
**As a prompt program lead, I want to publish a vetted prompt library to our marketplace so other workspaces can discover and import it.**

This slice closes the loop by letting owners push a shared library through a lightweight approval workflow and exposing a basic public listing.

## üéØ Walking Skeleton Goals
- Enable owners to submit an existing prompt library for publication with minimal metadata.
- Provide a reviewer queue where compliance can approve or reject submissions.
- Expose approved libraries on a simple marketplace listing page with import/download.
- Track state transitions for auditing.

### Explicit Non-Goals
- Monetisation, ratings, or analytics dashboards.
- Version history comparisons or diff visualisation.
- External webhooks or email campaigns.

## üë§ Personas & Pain Points
| Persona | Needs | Pain Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt Program Lead | Distribute vetted prompts broadly | Must export manually and share via docs |
| Compliance Reviewer | Ensure only compliant prompts are public | Lacks queue, relies on ad-hoc reviews |
| Marketplace Consumer | Find approved templates quickly | No central catalogue |

## ‚úÖ Success Signals
- A submission moves from Draft ‚Üí Approved and appears in marketplace listing.
- Rejected submission records reason and returns to Draft state.
- Import button clones library into consumer workspace in staging test.

## üì¶ Scope & Acceptance Criteria
1. **Submission Form**
   - Owners choose library ‚Üí fill minimal metadata (title, summary ‚â§280 chars, primary tag).
   - Submitting creates `marketplaceSubmission` record in `DRAFT` then `IN_REVIEW` state.
   - Form validates required fields and blocks duplicate active submissions per library.

2. **Reviewer Queue**
   - Compliance role sees `/marketplace/review` list with submissions, metadata, and quick preview of prompts.
   - Reviewer can approve (state ‚Üí `APPROVED`) or reject (‚Üí `REJECTED` with reason text).
   - Decisions append to audit log with actor, state change, reason.

3. **Marketplace Listing**
   - Public `/marketplace` page lists approved libraries (title, summary, owner, updatedAt).
   - ‚ÄúImport‚Äù button calls `POST /api/marketplace/import/:submissionId` to clone library into requester workspace (requires auth).
   - Approved listings cached for 10 minutes to reduce load.

### Definition of Done
- Submission ‚Üí approval ‚Üí marketplace listing works end-to-end in staging.
- Import endpoint clones prompts and associates them with requesting workspace.
- Cypress flow covers submit, approve, and import happy path.
- Feature flag `collaboration.marketplace` layered on prior flags.

## üß≠ Experience Outline
1. Owner opens library ‚Üí selects ‚ÄúPublish to Marketplace‚Äù.
2. Fills title/summary/tag ‚Üí submits ‚Üí sees confirmation banner.
3. Reviewer visits queue ‚Üí opens submission ‚Üí approves.
4. Library appears on marketplace listing ‚Üí consumer clicks Import ‚Üí library arrives in their workspace with ‚ÄúImported from Marketplace‚Äù badge.

## üß± Technical Notes
### Data Model (Prisma-ish pseudocode)
```ts
model MarketplaceSubmission {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  libraryId     String
  workspaceId   String   // owner workspace
  status        SubmissionStatus @default(DRAFT)
  metadata      Json
  submittedById String
  reviewerId    String?
  reviewedAt    DateTime?
  rejectionReason String?
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum SubmissionStatus {
  DRAFT
  IN_REVIEW
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
}
```

- Approved submissions materialised into `MarketplaceListing` view for faster reads.

### API Surface
| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/marketplace/submissions` | Create + auto mark `IN_REVIEW`. |
| `PATCH /api/marketplace/submissions/:id` | Approve/reject (reviewer only). |
| `GET /api/marketplace/listings` | List approved entries (public). |
| `POST /api/marketplace/import/:id` | Clone library into requester workspace. |

### UI Hooks
- Library toolbar button ‚Üí modal for metadata.
- Reviewer dashboard (table with approve/reject actions).
- Marketplace public page (cards with title/summary/import).

## üîê Security & Compliance
- Reviewers limited to compliance group defined via existing RBAC service.
- Import endpoint checks marketplace flag and ensures consumer workspace ‚â† producer.
- Audit log records submission, approval, rejection, and import events.

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- **Unit:** Submission service prevents duplicates, enforces transitions.
- **Integration:** Submit ‚Üí approve ‚Üí verify listing ‚Üí import clones prompts.
- **E2E:** Cypress spec for owner submit + reviewer approve + consumer import.

## üöÄ Rollout Checklist
1. Launch internally with curated set of libraries.
2. Ensure moderation queue handles load (target <200 ms response for list).
3. Open to select beta customers; monitor import success rate and rejection reasons.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- **Low quality listings:** Add basic checklist copy in form, require summary.
- **Reviewer bottleneck:** Provide Slack alert webhook for pending submissions (future enhancement).

## manual tests

manual test scenarios for E3S2 feedback threads
(Use two personas: Owner with library ownership, Viewer with share access; ensure collaboration.sharing flag already on.)

1. Feature flag gating
FF-01 Enablement:
Pre: collaboration.comments = ON. Viewer opens shared prompt.
Steps: Refresh prompt detail.
Expected: Feedback tab visible with form, ‚ÄúNo feedback yet‚Äù placeholder.
FF-02 Disabled behavior:
Pre: Turn flag OFF while story1 flag stays ON.
Steps: Hard refresh prompt detail and comments API call.

2. Permissions & access
PERM-01 Authorized commenter:
Pre: Viewer has viewer role.
Steps: Submit valid 100-char comment.
Expected: Comment appears instantly; persisted after reload.
PERM-02 Unauthorized user blocked:
Pre: User without library share attempts POST via UI/API.
Steps: Submit comment.
Expected: UI shows ‚Äúinsufficient permissions‚Äù; API returns 403; no audit event.
PERM-03 Owner access:

Steps: Owner deletes someone else‚Äôs comment.
Expected: Same soft-delete behavior; viewer sees removal on refresh.
DELETE-03 Unauthorized delete blocked:
Steps: Different viewer attempts delete on another user‚Äôs comment.
Expected: Button hidden or action returns 403; audit intact.
DELETE-04 Deleted comment hidden after refresh:
Steps: Hard reload UI and call list endpoint.

12. Regression guardrails
REG-01 Existing share functionality unaffected:
Steps: Verify original prompt details panel still loads when feature flag off.
Expected: No console errors.
REG-02 Toast system existing triggers unaffected:
Steps: Trigger known toast (story1) plus comment creation.
Expected: Both toasts queue correctly without collision.
execution notes
Use separate browsers (or profiles) to emulate owner/viewer simultaneously.
For telemetry/audit checks, coordinate with backend logging or inspect DB tables as described in docs (audit service).
Capture evidence (screenshots/logs) for each pass to support compliance verification.
Rate-limit and optimistic rollback tests are slower‚Äîschedule them toward the end to avoid hitting limits mid-run.
requirements coverage
E3S2 comment creation, display, permissions, notifications, telemetry, audit, soft delete, optimistic updates, rate-limits, sanitization, feature flag layering, and reuse of sharing roles are all addressed via the scenarios above.
