## 📄 `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

```markdown
# 🏗️ Architecture Overview — PromptPilot Pro

This document outlines the technical architecture of PromptPilot Pro, including service boundaries, data flow, and deployment strategy.

---

## 🔧 System Components

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (Vite)
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Model Integrator**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini
- **Execution Engine**: Queue-based (RabbitMQ or SQS)
- **Storage**: S3 or Blob for logs and outputs

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

- Local: Docker Compose
- Staging: Railway / Vercel
- Production: VPS or Kubernetes (TBD)

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- Logs stored per execution
- Health checks for services
- Metrics dashboard (future)
```

## 📄 `/docs/PROMPT_SCHEMA.md`

```markdown
# 🧾 Prompt Schema — PromptPilot Pro

This document defines the structure and validation rules for AI prompts used in the platform.

---

## 🧠 Prompt Object

```json
{
  "id": "prompt_123",
  "name": "Summarize Notes",
  "content": "Summarize the following notes: {{notes}}",
  "variables": ["notes"],
  "metadata": {
    "category": "summarization",
    "tags": ["meeting", "summary"]
  },
  "version": "1.2.0"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Validation Rules

- `content` must include all declared `variables`
- `name` must be unique within a workspace
- `version` follows semantic versioning
- `metadata.tags` must be lowercase, alphanumeric

---

## 🔄 Versioning Strategy

- Major changes → `1.x.x`
- Minor edits → `x.1.x`
- Metadata-only → `x.x.1`

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions

- Prompt chaining
- Conditional logic blocks
- Embedded model hints
```

---

## 📄 `/docs/WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md`

```markdown
# ⚙️ Workflow Engine — PromptPilot Pro

This document describes the logic, execution flow, and retry strategy for the workflow engine.

---

## 🧩 Execution Flow

1. Workflow triggered (manual, scheduled, or API)
2. Steps parsed in order
3. Each step:
   - Loads prompt
   - Injects variables
   - Sends to model
   - Stores output
4. Outputs passed to next step
5. Final result logged and returned

---

## 🔁 Retry Logic

- Max retries: 3
- Backoff strategy: exponential
- Timeout per step: 30s
- Failure states: logged with error code

---

## 🧠 Model Switching

- Each step can specify a different model
- Model parameters (temperature, maxTokens) are configurable
- Future support for fallback models

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Mock model responses
- Simulated workflows with sample inputs
- Step-level assertions
```

---

## 📄 `/docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`

```markdown
# 🌐 External Integrations — PromptPilot Pro

This document outlines supported integrations and how workflows can be triggered or extended externally.

---

## 🔗 Supported Platforms

- Slack (incoming messages → workflow trigger)
- Zapier (workflow → action chain)
- Notion (output → page append)
- Webhooks (custom triggers and delivery)

---

## 🧾 IntegrationHook Object

```json
{
  "id": "hook_001",
  "type": "webhook",
  "targetUrl": "https://example.com/receive",
  "authToken": "abc123",
  "linkedWorkflowId": "workflow_789"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Security

- All hooks require token-based auth
- Rate limits apply to external triggers
- Logs include source IP and timestamp

---

## 📦 Future Integrations

- Google Sheets
- Discord
- Email delivery
- Custom plugin SDK
```
