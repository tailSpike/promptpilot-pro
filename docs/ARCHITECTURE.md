Here you go, Rodney—here’s a full scaffold of the remaining optional documentation files for your `/docs` folder. These are structured with clear headings, placeholder sections, and suggested content so you or your team can expand them naturally as the platform evolves.

# 🏗️ PromptPilot Pro — Architecture Overview

PromptPilot Pro is delivered as a TypeScript monorepo composed of a backend API, a frontend SPA, and shared tooling. The platform currently ships as a modular monolith with clear service boundaries, making it easy to evolve toward service extraction if scale demands it.

## 1. High-level topology
```
[React SPA]
   │  HTTPS (fetch)
   ▼
[Express API Gateway]
   │  service calls
   ├── Auth Service
   ├── Prompt Service
   ├── Workflow Service
   └── Trigger Service (scheduler)
   │
   ▼
[Prisma ORM]
   │  SQL

[SQLite dev/test] ⇢ [PostgreSQL production]
```

- **Frontend (`frontend/`)** — React + Vite SPA served separately during development and via Vite preview in production. It communicates exclusively through the authenticated REST API.
- **Backend (`backend/`)** — Express application exposing REST endpoints under `/api`. Business logic is implemented via service classes (e.g., `TriggerService`, `WorkflowService`) to keep controllers thin.
- **Scheduler** — The backend hosts a singleton cron scheduler managed by `TriggerService`. Scheduled triggers are restored at startup, tracked in-memory, and persisted to the `workflow_triggers` table.
- **Shared resources** — Prisma schema, Zod validators, and TypeScript types provide a shared contract between layers.

---

## 2. Backend architecture

### Entry points
- `src/index.ts` configures Express, wires middleware, mounts route modules, initializes cron triggers, and exposes graceful shutdown handlers.
- Route modules live in `src/routes/`. Each route authenticates requests, validates payloads with Zod, then delegates to a service.

### Services & responsibilities
| Service | Key responsibilities |
|---------|----------------------|
| `AuthService` | User login/registration, JWT issuing, password hashing |
| `PromptService` | Prompt CRUD, versioning, execution history |
| `WorkflowService` | Workflow CRUD, step management, execution metadata |
| `TriggerService` | Trigger CRUD, config validation, cron lifecycle, API key/secret generation |

### Persistence
- Prisma manages migrations and provides a typed client (`src/generated/prisma`).
- SQLite is the default dev/test database. Switching to PostgreSQL is a `DATABASE_URL` change.
- All JSON columns (`config`, `metadata`, etc.) are serialized/deserialized in the services to keep route payloads ergonomic.

### Scheduling lifecycle
1. On boot, `TriggerService.initializeScheduledTriggers()` fetches active `SCHEDULED` triggers, parses configs, and registers node-cron tasks.
2. Updates or deletes stop and restart affected cron jobs immediately.
3. Shutdown hooks call `stopAllScheduledTriggers()` to avoid orphaned jobs.
4. Cron callbacks currently log execution intent; wiring into `WorkflowService` is the next milestone.

---

## 3. Frontend architecture
- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript compiled with Vite.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes plus light custom components.
- **State management**: Local component state with derived selectors; API calls centralised in `src/services/api.ts` using Axios.
- **Routing**: React Router 7.
- **Trigger UI**: `WorkflowTriggers.tsx` owns scheduling forms, cron helpers, and preview cards.
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for unit/component specs; Cypress for end-to-end flows.

---

## 4. Cross-cutting concerns
- **Authentication**: JWT bearer tokens issued by the backend and verified by middleware (`src/middleware/auth.ts`).
- **Validation**: Zod schemas applied at route boundaries, shared between create/update operations.
- **Error handling**: Central Express error middleware normalises responses and hides stack traces outside development.
- **Logging**: Console-level logging today; adapters are abstracted to support structured logging later.
- **Configuration**: `.env` drives environment-specific values (ports, database URL, CORS, frontend origin).

---

## 5. Deployment considerations
- **Single container**: The backend can be containerised with Node 20 LTS, running `npm run start`. Vite preview serves the frontend bundle.
- **Static hosting**: Alternatively, deploy the frontend bundle separately (e.g., Vercel/S3) and point it to the hosted API via `VITE_API_URL`.
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL in production; run migrations via `npm run db:migrate` before the first boot.
- **Scheduler**: Ensure only one instance of the backend handles cron jobs or add distributed locking if scaling horizontally.

---

## 6. Future evolution
- Replace cron logging with end-to-end workflow execution in the scheduler path.
- Introduce a queue/worker tier when concurrency requirements exceed single-node cron feasibility.
- Expand the `EVENT` trigger type to listen to internal domain events or external bus messages.
- Add structured logging/observability (OpenTelemetry) and centralised secrets management.

## 📄 `/docs/PROMPT_SCHEMA.md`

```markdown
# 🧾 Prompt Schema — PromptPilot Pro

This document defines the structure and validation rules for AI prompts used in the platform.

---

## 🧠 Prompt Object

```json
{
  "id": "prompt_123",
  "name": "Summarize Notes",
  "content": "Summarize the following notes: {{notes}}",
  "variables": ["notes"],
  "metadata": {
    "category": "summarization",
    "tags": ["meeting", "summary"]
  },
  "version": "1.2.0"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Validation Rules

- `content` must include all declared `variables`
- `name` must be unique within a workspace
- `version` follows semantic versioning
- `metadata.tags` must be lowercase, alphanumeric

---

## 🔄 Versioning Strategy

- Major changes → `1.x.x`
- Minor edits → `x.1.x`
- Metadata-only → `x.x.1`

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions

- Prompt chaining
- Conditional logic blocks
- Embedded model hints
```

---

## 📄 `/docs/WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md`

```markdown
# ⚙️ Workflow Engine — PromptPilot Pro

This document describes the logic, execution flow, and retry strategy for the workflow engine.

---

## 🧩 Execution Flow

1. Workflow triggered (manual, scheduled, or API)
2. Steps parsed in order
3. Each step:
   - Loads prompt
   - Injects variables
   - Sends to model
   - Stores output
4. Outputs passed to next step
5. Final result logged and returned

---

## 🔁 Retry Logic

- Max retries: 3
- Backoff strategy: exponential
- Timeout per step: 30s
- Failure states: logged with error code

---

## 🧠 Model Switching

- Each step can specify a different model
- Model parameters (temperature, maxTokens) are configurable
- Future support for fallback models

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Mock model responses
- Simulated workflows with sample inputs
- Step-level assertions
```
