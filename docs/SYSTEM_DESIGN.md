# 🧠 PromptPilot Pro — System Design (RESHADED Framework)

## R — Requirements

### Functional
- Create, edit, and version structured prompts with variables
- Chain prompts into multi-step workflows with branching logic
- Execute workflows across multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Capture and store execution logs, outputs, and feedback
- Share prompts and workflows with teams or publicly
- Integrate with external tools (Zapier, Slack, Notion, etc.)
- Provide analytics on usage, performance, and feedback

### Non-Functional
- Scalable architecture for concurrent executions
- Secure role-based access control (RBAC)
- Low-latency model response handling
- Extensible plugin/integration system
- GDPR-compliant data handling

---

## E — Estimation

### MVP Scope (3–4 months)
- Prompt Composer (with variables and metadata)
- Workflow Builder (linear chaining)
- Execution Engine (single-model support)
- User authentication and workspace management
- Basic sharing and feedback system
- Model integration with OpenAI (GPT-4)

### Team Estimate
- 1 PM / UX Designer  
- 2–3 Backend Engineers  
- 2 Frontend Engineers  
- 1 DevOps / Infra  
- 1 QA / Test Automation

---

## S — Storage

### Primary Data Models
- `Prompt`: id, name, content, variables[], metadata, version
- `Workflow`: id, name, steps[], triggers, owner, status
- `ExecutionLog`: id, workflowId, promptId, input, output, model, timestamp
- `User`: id, email, role, preferences
- `Feedback`: id, executionId, rating, comment, tags

### Storage Strategy
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- S3 or Blob Storage for large outputs and logs
- Redis for caching model responses and rate limits
- ElasticSearch for fast prompt search and tagging

## H — High-Level Design

### Modular Architecture
[Frontend UI] ←→ [API Gateway] ↓ ┌────────────┬────────────┐ │ Prompt Service         │ │ Workflow Service       │ │ Execution Engine       │ │ Model Integrator       │ │ Feedback & Analytics   │ │ Auth & Access Control  │ └────────────┴────────────┘ ↓ [Database Layer] ↓ [External APIs]

- Microservices or modular monolith depending on scale
- Event-driven execution engine (queue-based)
- Secure API gateway with token-based auth

- Secure API gateway with token-based auth

## A — API Design

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /prompts` – create a new prompt  
- `GET /prompts/:id` – retrieve prompt details  
- `POST /workflows` – create a new workflow  
- `POST /workflows/:id/execute` – run a workflow  
- `GET /logs/:id` – fetch execution log  
- `POST /feedback` – submit feedback  
- `POST /auth/login` – user authentication  
- `GET /models` – list available AI models

### Auth Strategy
- JWT-based sessions  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

---

## D — Data Flow

### Workflow Execution
1. User triggers workflow execution
2. Workflow Engine parses steps
3. Each step invokes a prompt with variables
4. Model Integrator sends prompt to selected AI model
5. Response is captured and stored in ExecutionLog
6. Feedback module allows rating and annotation
7. Analytics module aggregates usage data

### Prompt Creation
1. User opens Prompt Composer
2. Defines variables and metadata
3. Saves version to database
4. Optionally shares or links to workflow

---

## E — Enhancements

### Post-MVP Roadmap
- Multi-model switching within workflows
- Conditional branching and loop logic
- Prompt marketplace for public sharing and monetization
- Plugin SDK for custom integrations
- Team collaboration features (comments, suggestions)
- Advanced analytics (A/B testing, heatmaps)
- AI-assisted prompt optimization

---

## D — Deep Dive

### Execution Engine
- Queue-based system (RabbitMQ or AWS SQS)
- Each workflow step is a job with retry logic
- Supports parallel execution and timeout handling
- Logs all inputs/outputs for traceability

### Prompt Schema
```json
{
  "id": "prompt_123",
  "name": "Summarize Meeting Notes",
  "content": "Summarize the following notes: {{notes}}",
  "variables": ["notes"],
  "metadata": {
    "category": "summarization",
    "tags": ["meeting", "summary"]
  },
  "version": "1.2.0"
}
