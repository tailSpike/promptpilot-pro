## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Data Models

#### Workflow
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  folderId?: string;
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  variables: WorkflowVariable[];
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    version: string;
    tags: string[];
  };
  isTemplate: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

#### WorkflowStep
```typescript
interface WorkflowStep {
  id: string;
  type: 'prompt' | 'decision' | 'transform' | 'condition';
  name: string;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  config: PromptStepConfig | DecisionStepConfig | TransformStepConfig;
  inputs: VariableMapping[];
  outputs: VariableMapping[];
  nextSteps: string[];
  conditions?: ExecutionCondition[];
}
```

#### Execution Context
```typescript
interface WorkflowExecution {
  id: string;
  workflowId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  inputData: Record<string, any>;
  stepResults: StepExecutionResult[];
  error?: ExecutionError;
}
```

### API Endpoints
