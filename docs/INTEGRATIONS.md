# üåê External Integrations ‚Äî PromptPilot Pro

PromptPilot Pro exposes multiple trigger types that allow external systems to launch workflows. This document summarises the current capabilities and planned integrations.

---

## 1. Supported today

### Webhook triggers
- Endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/:triggerId`
- Security: HMAC secret generated per trigger (`config.secret`). Include signature headers in outbound requests (HMAC enforcement on the backend is scheduled next).
- Payload: Arbitrary JSON. Future iterations will provide schema validation hints.

### API triggers
- Endpoint: `POST /api/triggers/:id/execute`
- Authentication: Include `x-api-key` header using the generated `config.apiKey`.
- Use cases: Internal services or scripts that need deterministic workflow kicks.

### Manual triggers
- UI-driven, but useful for integrating with CLI scripts or GitHub Actions via the API trigger path.

---

## 2. Near-term roadmap
- **Webhook signature verification**: Validate incoming payloads using `config.secret` and standard headers (`x-signature`, `x-timestamp`).
- **Payload mapping**: Allow storing JSONPath expressions that map webhook fields to workflow variables.
- **Outgoing webhooks**: Support delivering workflow outputs to external URLs.

---

## 3. Longer-term ideas
- Slack and Teams command handlers that translate messages into workflow executions.
- Zapier/Make connectors using the API trigger surface.
- Native integrations for Notion, Google Sheets, and email to distribute outputs.
- Event bus listeners (Kafka/EventBridge) via the `EVENT` trigger type.

## 4. Provider credentials

The new **Integration Keys** console lets workspace owners store encrypted API credentials for model providers. The experience is now enabled by default and appears under **Settings ‚Üí Integration Keys** in the navigation.

### Available providers

The backend ships with a registry in `backend/src/config/providers.ts` that currently covers OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Azure OpenAI. Update this file to surface extra providers or scopes.

### API surface

- `GET /api/integrations/providers` ‚Äî list metadata for configured providers.
- `GET /api/integrations/credentials` ‚Äî fetch stored credentials for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/integrations/credentials` ‚Äî create a credential (secret encrypted with AES-256-GCM via `KeyVaultService`).
- `PATCH /api/integrations/credentials/:id` ‚Äî rotate a key (provide `secret`) or update labels/metadata.
- `DELETE /api/integrations/credentials/:id` ‚Äî revoke a credential (soft delete).

All write operations emit audit logs via `AuditService`. Secrets never leave the server decrypted.

### Console workflow

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Integration Keys**.
2. Choose a provider, supply a label (e.g., `QA Sandbox`), and paste the API key.
3. Optional JSON metadata can tag sandbox credentials for CI use.
4. Existing keys can be rotated or revoked with quick actions.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  For sandboxes without real providers, the UI accepts fake secrets; however, do not store production credentials in shared preview environments yet ‚Äî KMS adapters beyond the local fallback are planned in Epic 4 Story 3.

If you plan to implement an integration, document the usage pattern in this file and add a reference example in the docs or `/examples` directory.
```

### 5. CI: Live provider smoke checks (optional)

The repository includes a scheduled and on-demand GitHub Actions workflow to verify external model providers are reachable with your CI-injected secrets. This runs a lightweight Cypress spec that only hits public provider endpoints; it does not start the app.

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/provider-smoke.yml`
- Cypress spec: `frontend/cypress/e2e/provider-smoke.cy.ts`

Secrets to configure in your repository (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (maps to `CYPRESS_OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (maps to `CYPRESS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (maps to `CYPRESS_GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (maps to `CYPRESS_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` (maps to `CYPRESS_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, e.g., `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com`)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` (maps to `CYPRESS_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, optional)

Notes
- Tests are self-skipping: if a provider‚Äôs secret(s) aren‚Äôt present, that provider‚Äôs test is skipped instead of failing.
- Azure API version default in the spec is `2024-02-15-preview`. If your region/resource requires a different version (for example, a newer GA), set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` accordingly in repo secrets.
- The Azure test calls `GET {endpoint}/openai/deployments?api-version=...` and expects a response with a `value` array.
- Artifacts (screenshots/videos) are uploaded only if present.

Manual runs
- From the Actions tab, select ‚ÄúProvider Smoke (Live Providers)‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúRun workflow‚Äù.
- Cron schedule runs daily at 05:00 UTC.

Security of stored keys
- Keys saved via the Integration Keys console are encrypted at-rest using AES-256-GCM by the backend KeyVault service.
- CI secrets remain within GitHub Actions and are injected only for the smoke workflow job. They are not persisted in the app database.

Runbook note
- After rotating any CI provider secrets (in GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions), manually trigger the ‚ÄúProvider Smoke (Live Providers)‚Äù workflow to validate connectivity immediately. The job summary will display a per-provider table with status, latency, and tokens (when available).

### 6. Revoked credentials behavior (Preview runs)

When all targeted providers for a workflow preview have only revoked credentials for the current user/workspace, the backend fails fast with an explicit 409 response so the UI can surface an actionable message instead of silently simulating.

Status: 409 Conflict

```json
{
  "status": "FAILED",
  "usedSampleData": false,
  "totalDurationMs": 0,
  "stats": { "stepsExecuted": 0, "tokensUsed": 0 },
  "warnings": ["Credential revoked. Re-authorise before running this workflow."],
  "stepResults": [],
  "finalOutput": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "provider.credentials.revoked",
    "message": "Credential revoked",
    "providers": ["openai", "anthropic"]
  }
}
```

Notes
- Applies when preview runs would require external provider calls and `simulateOnly` is not set.
- If at least one ACTIVE credential exists for any targeted provider, the preview continues using available credentials.
- Use Integration Keys to rotate a new credential, then re-run the preview to clear this warning.
