# ðŸ”Œ API Reference â€” PromptPilot Pro

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. Unless noted, endpoints require a valid JWT bearer token obtained from the authentication APIs.

---

## 1. Authentication & health

### POST `/api/auth/register`
Registers a new user.
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "strong-password",
  "name": "Aviator"
}
```
**Response**
```json
{
  "token": "JWT",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_cuid",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "Aviator"
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/auth/login`
Authenticates an existing user. Response matches registration.

### GET `/api/health`
Public health check that returns `{ "status": "ok" }` when the backend is alive.

---

## 2. Folders

### GET `/api/folders`
Returns the folder hierarchy for the authenticated user. Each node includes `_count` metadata for prompts and children.

### POST `/api/folders`
Create a folder.
```json
{
  "name": "Campaigns",
  "description": "Marketing workflows",
  "color": "#3B82F6",
  "parentId": null
}
```

### GET `/api/folders/:id`
Fetch folder details.

### PUT `/api/folders/:id`
Update folder metadata.

### DELETE `/api/folders/:id`
Delete the folder. Include optional `moveToFolderId` query param to re-parent contents before deletion.

---

## 3. Prompts

### GET `/api/prompts`
List prompts with optional query parameters (`folderId`, `search`, pagination).

### POST `/api/prompts`
Create a prompt.
```json
{
  "name": "Summarise Notes",
  "content": "Summarise the following notes: {{notes}}",
  "variables": [
    { "name": "notes", "type": "text", "description": "Raw meeting notes" }
  ],
  "metadata": { "category": "reporting" },
  "folderId": null,
  "isPublic": false
}
```

### GET `/api/prompts/:id`
Retrieve prompt details including current version and execution count.

### PUT `/api/prompts/:id`
Update prompt metadata, content, or variables. Supports semantic version change types via `changeType` and `commitMessage`.

### DELETE `/api/prompts/:id`
Remove a prompt.

### POST `/api/prompts/:id/execute`
Execute a prompt with runtime variables.
```json
{
  "variables": {
    "notes": "Weekly highlights..."
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Workflows

### GET `/api/workflows`
List workflows owned by the user. Supports `folderId`, `search`, `limit`, `offset` query params.

### POST `/api/workflows`
Create a workflow.
```json
{
  "name": "Weekly Report",
  "description": "Summarise notes and mail them",
  "folderId": null,
  "tags": ["weekly", "report"],
  "isActive": true
}
```

### GET `/api/workflows/:id`
Return workflow details including steps, recent executions, and owner metadata.

### PUT `/api/workflows/:id`
Update workflow metadata (`name`, `description`, `isActive`).

### DELETE `/api/workflows/:id`
Delete a workflow and its dependent entities.

---

## 5. Workflow steps

### POST `/api/workflows/:id/steps`
Create a step. `type` determines which config fields are required.
```json
{
  "name": "Draft summary",
  "type": "PROMPT",
  "order": 0,
  "promptId": "prompt_cuid",
  "config": {
    "variables": {
      "notes": "workflowInput.weeklyNotes"
    },
    "modelSettings": {
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "temperature": 0.6
    }
  }
}
```

### PUT `/api/workflows/:id/steps/:stepId`
Update step name, order, prompt, or config payload.

### DELETE `/api/workflows/:id/steps/:stepId`
Remove a step.

### POST `/api/workflows/:id/execute`
Kick off a workflow execution. Currently returns an acknowledgement payload while the execution engine is integrated.
```json
{
  "input": {
    "weeklyNotes": "Highlights from the week"
  },
  "triggerType": "MANUAL"
}
```

---

## 6. Triggers & scheduling

### GET `/api/workflows/:workflowId/triggers`
List triggers for the workflow with recent execution summaries.

### POST `/api/workflows/:workflowId/triggers`
Create a trigger. Config requirements vary by `type`.
```json
{
  "name": "Every weekday at 8am",
  "type": "SCHEDULED",
  "config": {
    "cron": "0 8 * * 1-5",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```
- Scheduled triggers require a valid cron expression.
- Webhook triggers auto-generate `secret` if omitted.
- API triggers auto-generate `apiKey` if omitted.

### GET `/api/triggers/:id`
Fetch trigger details with the latest executions.

### PUT `/api/triggers/:id`
Update trigger metadata or config. Changing the type resets config to avoid stale fields.

### DELETE `/api/triggers/:id`
Delete a trigger and stop any scheduled jobs.

### POST `/api/triggers/:id/execute`
Manual/API trigger execution endpoint. Currently returns an acknowledgement payload while execution wiring is finalised.
```json
{
  "message": "Trigger execution requested",
  "triggerId": "trigger_cuid",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### POST `/api/webhooks/:triggerId`
Webhook entry point. Returns 200 after basic validation. Future work will validate HMAC signatures using `config.secret`.

---

## 7. Error handling
Errors follow a consistent shape:
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid input",
  "details": [
    {
      "path": ["config", "cron"],
      "message": "Cron expression is required"
    }
  ]
}
```
- `400` for validation failures (Zod errors).
- `401` for missing/invalid authentication.
- `403` reserved for future multi-tenant features.
- `404` when resources are not found or not owned by the user.
- `500` for unexpected server errors.

---

## 8. Rate limiting & security
- JWT secret configured via `JWT_SECRET`; rotate regularly in production.
- Webhook and API triggers generate random 256-bit secrets that should be stored securely by clients.
- Add reverse proxies (Nginx/Cloudflare) for rate limiting and TLS termination in production.

Refer to [`docs/WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md`](WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md) for trigger lifecycle details and [`docs/DEV_GUIDE.md`](DEV_GUIDE.md) for testing expectations.
