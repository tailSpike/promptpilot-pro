## 6. Libraries & sharing

> **Feature flag:** Requires `collaboration.sharing` to be enabled via `FEATURE_FLAG_COLLABORATION_SHARING`.

### POST `/api/libraries/:id/shares`
Share a prompt library (folder) with another workspace member.
```json
{
  "inviteeEmail": "teammate@example.com"
}
```
**Responses**
- `201` with share metadata (invitee, inviter, folder) when successful
- `404` when the folder is not owned by the requester
- `429` when exceeding the hourly invite rate limit
- `400` for invalid email or duplicate active share

### DELETE `/api/libraries/:id/shares/:shareId`
Revoke an existing share. Response body includes `message` confirmation.

### GET `/api/libraries/:id/shares`
List active shares for the owner, returning invitee details and audit metadata.

### GET `/api/libraries/shared-with-me`
List libraries the authenticated user can view, including owner and inviter information.

### GET `/api/libraries/:id`
Fetch a shared library summary (owner, prompt count, timestamps). Enforces access via ownership or viewer share.

### GET `/api/libraries/:id/prompts`
Return prompts within the library when the requester is the owner or has viewer access.

### GET `/api/users/search?q=term`
Member lookup used by the share modal. Requires at least two characters and returns up to ten matches.

---

## 7. Triggers & scheduling

### GET `/api/workflows/:workflowId/triggers`
List triggers for the workflow with recent execution summaries.

### POST `/api/workflows/:workflowId/triggers`
Create a trigger. Config requirements vary by `type`.
```json
{
  "name": "Every weekday at 8am",
  "type": "SCHEDULED",
  "config": {
    "cron": "0 8 * * 1-5",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```
- Scheduled triggers require a valid cron expression.
- Webhook triggers auto-generate `secret` if omitted.
- API triggers auto-generate `apiKey` if omitted.

### GET `/api/triggers/:id`
Fetch trigger details with the latest executions.

### PUT `/api/triggers/:id`
Update trigger metadata or config. Changing the type resets config to avoid stale fields.

### DELETE `/api/triggers/:id`
Delete a trigger and stop any scheduled jobs.

### POST `/api/triggers/:id/execute`
Manual/API trigger execution endpoint. Currently returns an acknowledgement payload while execution wiring is finalised.
```json
{
  "message": "Trigger execution requested",
  "triggerId": "trigger_cuid",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### POST `/api/webhooks/:triggerId`
Webhook entry point. Returns 200 after basic validation. Future work will validate HMAC signatures using `config.secret`.

---

## 8. Error handling
Errors follow a consistent shape:
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid input",
  "details": [
    {
      "path": ["config", "cron"],
      "message": "Cron expression is required"
    }
  ]
}
```
- `400` for validation failures (Zod errors).
- `401` for missing/invalid authentication.
- `403` reserved for future multi-tenant features.
- `404` when resources are not found or not owned by the user.
- `500` for unexpected server errors.

---

## 9. Rate limiting & security
- JWT secret configured via `JWT_SECRET`; rotate regularly in production.
- Webhook and API triggers generate random 256-bit secrets that should be stored securely by clients.
- Add reverse proxies (Nginx/Cloudflare) for rate limiting and TLS termination in production.

Refer to [`docs/WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md`](WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md) for trigger lifecycle details and [`docs/DEV_GUIDE.md`](DEV_GUIDE.md) for testing expectations.
