## Naming conventions (docs)
- New docs should use lower-kebab-case file names.
- Group by domain:
  - architecture/: system-design, workflow-engine, data-models, prompt-schema
  - epics/: per-epic subfolders (epic-1, epic-2, …) — migration in progress
  - guides/: dev-guide, standard-workflow, integrations, how-to
  - api/: api contracts and examples
  - testing/: automated (link to root TESTING.md) and manual guides
- If you create a new story doc, prefer epics/epic-N/story-name.md and add it to this index.
