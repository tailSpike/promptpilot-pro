# Epic 1 Story 3: Prompt Version Control & History Management

**Status:** ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE (Core Versioning MVP)
**User Story:** As a user, I want to version-control my prompts so I can track changes and revert when needed.

## ✅ Completed Features (Phase 1)
- **Automatic Versioning**: Semantic versioning system (major.minor.patch)
- **Version History**: Complete timeline with author, timestamp, and commit messages
- **Revert Functionality**: One-click revert to any previous version
- **API Endpoints**: Full REST API for version management
- **Frontend Integration**: Tab-based version history in PromptEditor
- **Change Tracking**: Automatic change type detection and metadata storage
- **Database Schema**: Optimized version storage with relationships

## Description
Users need comprehensive version control for their prompts to track evolution, collaborate safely, and maintain prompt quality over time. This includes automatic versioning on changes, detailed change history with diffs, branching for experimentation, and the ability to revert to any previous version.

## Detailed User Stories
- As a user, I want automatic version increments when I save prompt changes so I don't lose my editing history
- As a user, I want to see a visual diff between prompt versions so I can understand what changed
- As a user, I want to add commit messages when saving changes so I can document why changes were made
- As a user, I want to create named branches of my prompts so I can experiment without affecting the main version
- As a user, I want to merge experimental branches back to main when testing proves successful
- As a user, I want to revert to any previous version with one click so I can quickly undo problematic changes
- As a user, I want to see who made changes and when so I can track collaboration history
- As a user, I want to compare performance metrics across versions so I can identify the best-performing iterations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Versioning
- [x] Automatic semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) increments on prompt saves
- [x] Manual version type selection (patch/minor/major) based on change significance  
- [x] Immutable version history - versions cannot be deleted or modified once created
- [x] Version metadata includes timestamp, author, commit message, and change summary

### Change Tracking & Diffs
- [ ] Visual side-by-side diff view showing content, variable, and metadata changes
- [ ] Highlighted additions, deletions, and modifications with color coding
- [ ] Change statistics (lines added/removed, variables modified, etc.)
- [ ] Commit message system for documenting version changes

### Branching & Merging
- [ ] Create named branches from any version (e.g. "experiment-tone", "client-specific")
- [ ] Branch visualization showing relationship between main and experimental versions
- [ ] Three-way merge capability with conflict resolution for concurrent changes
- [ ] Branch comparison view to evaluate differences before merging

### Version Management UI
- [x] Version history timeline with expandable details for each version
- [x] One-click revert functionality with confirmation dialog
- [x] Version comparison selector (compare any two versions)
- [ ] Performance metrics overlay showing success rates per version

### Collaboration Features
- [ ] Change attribution showing who made each modification
- [ ] Version comments and annotations for collaborative review
- [ ] Version approval workflow for team environments
- [ ] Notification system for version changes in shared prompts

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Version tagging system (e.g. "production", "experimental", "deprecated")
- [ ] Automated backup creation before major changes
- [ ] Version-based rollback with dependency checking
- [ ] Export/import version history for prompt migration

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
- [ ] PromptVersion table with version metadata and content snapshots
- [ ] PromptBranch table for managing experimental branches
- [ ] VersionHistory table for tracking all changes and relationships
- [ ] Efficient storage system for version deltas to minimize database size

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /api/prompts/:id/versions` - List all versions
- [ ] `GET /api/prompts/:id/versions/:version` - Get specific version
- [ ] `POST /api/prompts/:id/versions` - Create new version
- [ ] `PUT /api/prompts/:id/revert/:version` - Revert to version
- [ ] `GET /api/prompts/:id/diff/:v1/:v2` - Compare versions
- [ ] `POST /api/prompts/:id/branches` - Create branch
- [ ] `PUT /api/prompts/:id/merge/:branch` - Merge branch

### Frontend Components
- [ ] `VersionHistory.tsx` - Timeline view of all versions
- [ ] `DiffViewer.tsx` - Side-by-side comparison component
- [ ] `BranchManager.tsx` - Branch creation and management
- [ ] `VersionSelector.tsx` - Version picker and revert interface

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Fast version retrieval and diff calculation for large prompts
- [ ] Pagination for version history in high-change prompts
- [ ] Caching for frequently accessed versions
- [ ] Background processing for complex merge operations

### Security & Data Integrity
- [ ] Version data integrity with checksums and validation
- [ ] Access control for version operations (read/write/revert permissions)
- [ ] Audit logging for all version control actions
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures for version data
